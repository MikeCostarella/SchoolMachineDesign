# School-Machine Design

School machine has a number of architectural components, each of which are small in enough in complexity to easily understand the domain aspects, and be to be easily implemented in multiple technologies, as new technologies appear.

The goal of this project is not create a fully functional web and mobile enabled application, but to identify the architectural components and patterns necessary to create a minimally viable product.
